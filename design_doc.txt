Elevator pitch:
    - A 2D top-down mobile game with two (local) players.
    - Each player controls a constantly accelerating car.
    - When two cars collide, the one with greater speed destroys the slower moving car.
    - A destoyed car respawns after a few seconds.
    - If a car hits a wall or an obstacle, it loses a degree of it's speed.
    - The game is real-time, but it's played in a series of rounds that last for a pre-determined amount of time (e.g. 1 minute).
    - When the timer runs out, the player with more explosions (score) wins the round.

Controls:
    - The game is meant to be played on the same touchscreen device, be it a phone or
    a tablet.
    - On each end of the screen, both players have a 'control track' they can move their
    finger on.
    - When the player moves the finger to the left, the car turns left. When they move
    their finger towards the right, the car turns right.
    - If the player keeps their finger in the middle of the 'control track',
    the car goes straight.
    - The 'tightness' of the turn is determined by the distance from the mid-point of the
    track. This means the player can go in circles, if they keep their finger on the far
    side of the 'control track'

Additional ideas and things to note:
    - To tie the game into the theme of the game jam ("melt"), the field on which the two
    cars battle each other could be made of ice or some other melting substance.
    With time, the area of the arena gets smaller and smaller, as it slowly melts down.
    - The two 'agents' or 'player characters' don't need to be cars per se, they can be
    e.g. space ships, ships, ice-hockey players, two knigths jousting etc. This does not change the
    main concept.
    - To add some depth and 'tactical feel' into the game, some 'boosts' or 'pickups' can
    be added. These could include short speed boost, additional droppable obstacles and
    other sort of 'weapons'.
